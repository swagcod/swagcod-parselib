This exists because I'm tired of there being no good parser combinator
library. It implements only what I need specifically. Its made for
(the guy who pretends to be) SwagCoD to use, not for you to use.

The problem with all other libraries is that either they aren't combinators,
and are thus way overkill for small projects which don't need to be fast,
or the author has somehow convinced themself that they are writing in Haskell
and decides that they must use monads, when the language doesn't have do-notation.

This uses monad-flavored combinators, but no monads. There is no .bind(). Parsers
are written as ordinary python functions, but use the @parser decorator to
minimally change them.
